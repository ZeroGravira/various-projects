This is a program designed to show a visual representation of a sorting algorithm at work. It is designed to show various algorithms. Currently it only shows the Bubble Sort algorithm, but more will be implemented in the future, and more robust controls will be added to alter the parameters of the search (e.g. the delay between passes through the array, the color scheme, the window size, etc.)

Run instructions for Linux:
$appletviewer SortVisualizer.java

Run instructions for Windows:
With the files SortVisualizer.html and SortVisualizerApplet.class in the same folder (the other files are unnecessary), simply open SortVisualizer.html in a browser. Provided Java is installed on the host computer, the visualizer should be displayed in the browser window.
